# You
## Please introduce yourself
- Hi, my name is Ken Flake, I'm currently working at UnionBank of the Philippines, and my role is a Software Engineer in the DevSecOps and Microservices Team.
- Since then, our projects are related to Citibank projects due to Unionbank acquiring Citibank. And just this month of April, we held the LD2 Migration which was quite a tiring experience for us since we have to support for the whole period.
- One of the projects assigned to me was named "Notification Engine", wherein, all types of notifications, whether it's SMS, Email, or In-app notification, it will all be orchestrated by this singular system.
- Also I have another project which uses AWS Lambda, it's just saving a recording of a conversation of an credit card agent and a customer. 

## What are the tech stacks that you use?
- We use Quarkus, a Java framework very similar to Spring, but it's more lightweight and more cloud-native than Spring.
- Our infrastructure use Kubernetes, and in particular, we use Red Hat OpenShift which is an enterprise version of Kubernetes provided by Red Hat. 
- In version control we use GitLab. Our CI/CD pipelines are also stored there.

## Why are you currently exploring for new opportunities?
I am exploring new opportunities to continue growing both personally and professionally. While I have thoroughly enjoyed my current role as a Software Engineer at UnionBank and have gained invaluable experience, I believe that new challenges are essential for continuous learning and development.

## How many years are your experience in Java?
I've been working using Java since 2018. So about 6 years.

## What interested you to apply to this position? 
I think I'm a good fit upon reading the job position for the role.

## Why do you want to join our company?
I have browsed through the SiteMinder website and I saw that you are a hotel commerce platform. You integrate with apps like Booking.com and Airbnb so that the rooms of the hotel will be seen there.

Because of this, I somehow recalled my thesis during my college days which was a Hotel Reservation System. It's a simple app that adds, edits and delete who is in a room of a small hotel. And can also reserve rooms.

## How do you handle tight deadlines and pressure?
I align with my Tech Lead to schedule tasks accordingly so we could prevent having tight deadlines. 

But there are times that some requirements are changed along the way and that causes the tight deadlines. Because of this, we have to reprioritize and we have to drop tasks that are non-prority, and begin with the tasks that should be prioritized. 

## What are your strengths?
I'd say that if there's a new technology that has never been introduced to the team, I excel in making a proof of concept of it and introducing and doing a brown bag session of it in the team.

## What are your weaknesses?
I'd say that I'm still lacking on the negotiating department. For example, if I want to extend the duration of my time effort of this task, sometimes I want to decline a task that's asked of me of my boss because I'm fully occupied, so you can say I'm a people pleaser, which I don't want to.
