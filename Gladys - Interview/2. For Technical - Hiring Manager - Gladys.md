# UnionBank Projects 

## Instapay ISO20022
- One of the contributors in this project
- Also helped in deploying this project to Production environment, as well as hypercare support and L3 support.
- Also supported in creating the necessary hotfixes during hypercare period.
- Adoption and upgrade to a standard messaging methodology known as ISO20022.
- The microservices aims to process Instapay payments while also to upgrade and adhere to the ISO20022 standard.
- High-level flow:
	- User will attempt to transfer money via Instapay in the Unionbank app.
	- The Unionbank app, also called "Channels", will send the API request to our microservice.
	- The microservice will process the Instapay payment as stated by the ISO20022 standard and as prescribed requirements by Bancnet.
	- Involved consistent collaboration with Bancnet.
- It aims to create consistent message standards across business processes and a key tool in real-time payments structure.
- This project involves heave DB saving and indexing.
- We also made use of the Materialized View feature of PostgreSQL.

## Personal Loans Calculator
- Main Contributor in this project
- Also helped in deploying this project to Production environment, as well as hypercare support and L3 support.
- Involves integration with Samsung Finance API
- The flow looks like this: 
	- a customer will buy a phone, let's say in the Samsung Shop.
	- the customers avails the loan option by Samsung Finance.
	- Samsung Finance will send the details of the loan in our microservice.
	- Then, the microservice will process the loan to the internal core banking system of UnionBank which is Finacle.
	- After the loan is saved properly in the core banking system, it will make a payment callback to Samsung Finance indicating that the transaction has completed.
- It can also handle "Late Fee" scenarios, this is the high-level flow:
	- the core banking system has a functionality to collect all payments which is beyond their due dates to a file to an SFTP server.
	- we created a Kubernetes Cron Job every 12am as a trigger to check the said SFTP server.
	- the microservice will parse the file and collect all the payments with late fees.
	- after collecting, the microservice will send these details to the specific Samsung Finance callback API
- It involves DB saving and retrieval and saving of some files to an SFTP server.
- Since the call is from outside / external service which is Samsung Finance, this project also involved the collaboration with our API Gateway team to cater the external call to route to our microservice accordingly.
